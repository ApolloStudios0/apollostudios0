- I am a Software Developer with 4+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications and open-source software.
- Due to my work, most of regular projects are closed-source or hosted on an external Platform seperate from GitHub.

### My Opensource Story
My projects released as open-source on GitHub (This is not even close to the amount I work on daily!):
- [OctoSync](https://github.com/NebulaFX/OctoSync) - This is a project which connects multiple physical EPOS terminals together via asynchronous SQL operations. In a nutshell, you enter the "Client" connection string, then enter the "server" connection string. It will sync an EPOS stock table betweeen the two stores based on: Product Name, Internal Reference Code or Supplier Code. Once the full upload has been completed, the tables are kept up-to-date in live time.
- [Influx](https://github.com/NebulaFX/PremierEPOS_InfluxTicketing) - This is a business specific, bestoke application built for the purpose of logging customer complaints, queries and being used a base for development suggestions. Its a glorified ticketing system that breaks down a customers profile into: Invoices, PDA Connections, Terminals, License Key Adjustments and other useful support tools.
-  [Express Inventory](https://github.com/NebulaFX/-In-Dev-Express-Inventory) - Express Inventory is a modern inventory, replenishment and order management system for growing businesses. This is combined with a Key Management Server (AWS) to assist in providing secure transactions and user authentication.
