### Hi there <a href="http://www.Joelwoods.uk/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>
This is my home, my kingdom, my little project sandbox :rofl:

- üî≠ &nbsp;I‚Äôm currently working on something cool :wink:
- üå± &nbsp;I‚Äôm currently learning more about JavaScript
- üí¨ &nbsp;Ask me about anything related to C#, WPF or WinForms

I am a Software Developer with 2+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications and open-source software.

### My Opensource Story
Most of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub:
- [OctoSync](https://github.com/NebulaFX/OctoSync) - This is a project which connects multiple physical EPOS terminals together via asynchronous SQL operations. In a nutshell, you enter the "Client" connection string, then enter the "server" connection string. It will sync an EPOS stock table betweeen the two stores based on: Product Name, Internal Reference Code or Supplier Code. Once the full upload has been completed, the tables are kept up-to-date in live time.
- [Influx](https://github.com/NebulaFX/PremierEPOS_InfluxTicketing) - This is a business specific, bestoke application built for the purpose of logging customer complaints, queries and being used a base for development suggestions. Its a glorified ticketing system that breaks down a customers profile into: Invoices, PDA Connections, Terminals, License Key Adjustments and other useful support tools.
-  [Shopify Api Re-Worked](https://github.com/NebulaFX/PE_API_V3) - Small API that takes the body: CustomerNumber, ShopifyUrl, ShopifyKey, ShopifyPassword & returns all of the product information using paiged requests on the Shopify 2022 API.
